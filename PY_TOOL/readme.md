# Wrapping tools
These tools are in a preliminary stage of development so use with caution

These tools are aimed to help understand the structure of the code and the context of functions. With the preliminary aim of aiding cython wrapping and the end goal of some level of wrapping automation. 

This may be useful for the following reasons

* Work on SEVN is still active so it may be cumbersome to wrap manually every major git update
* Errors are prone to happen if changes to every small part is applied repeatedly and manually through the code 
* To learn better understand the relationships between functions of the code.
